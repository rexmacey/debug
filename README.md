# debug
A repository to make public code and data which is causing a problem
The rmd controls the code and when knitted creates a pdf.  The Control.xlsx workbook has the data.  debug1.pdf has the output the way I think it should be.  The Taxable  row, PreTaxvValue column has "100,000".  In debug, this value appears as "1e05"
